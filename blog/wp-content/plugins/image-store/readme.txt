Image Store (ImStore) is a photo gallery and store plugin for WordPress with Paypal and Google Checkout integration.

== Description ==
This plugin was created because there was a need in the WorPress community to have an images store that did not required the installation of multiple plugins. Enjoy!! and please support the plugin. :@) 

The plugin fully integrated with the WordPress database it only creates a post_expire column on the posts table.
so you will not find extra tables on your database(Cool!.. at least for me I hate extra tables).
