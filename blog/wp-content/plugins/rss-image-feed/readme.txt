The RSS Image Feed adds the first image of a post to your feeds, even in firefox and even if you only display the excerpt.

== Description ==

The RSS Image Feed doesn't create a feed of images, but ataches the first image of the post to your feeds. Normally only the content has images showing. With our plugin there will be a clickable image even in the excerpt and in the content there will be only one image instead of all the images of the post.

The plugin was tested up to WP 3.4. It should work with versions down to 2.7 but was never tested on those.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `image-rss` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
