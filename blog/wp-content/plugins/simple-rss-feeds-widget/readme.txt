This widget displays links to the latest posts of a custom list of third party RSS feeds.

== Description ==

This widget displays titles and links to the latest posts of a custom list of third party RSS feeds. It is useful for people who want to follow third party feeds updates on their own blog. It is also useful for blog networks where each blog can promote the latest posts of other blogs of the network.

Features list:

* Customizable title.
* Customizable introduction displayed before the recently updated feeds list.
* Customizable number of maximum posts displayed from the same source.
* Customizable number of maximum posts displayed in total.
* Localized economy and market share news feeds supplied by default for immediate use (many thanks to [Bourse en ligne](http://www.labourseenaction.fr/ "La bourse en action") for both English and French original news feeds).

Languages supported:

* English
* French

The plugin uses WordPress standard localization functions for localization. So, adding support for new languages (including the list of default RSS feeds, separated by "!") should be straightforward.
