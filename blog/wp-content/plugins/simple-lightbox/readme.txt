A simple, themeable, and customizable Lightbox for Wordpress

== Description ==
Simple Lightbox is a very simple and customizable lightbox that is easy to add to your Wordpress website.  It also [supports themes](http://archetyped.com/lab/slb-registering-themes/), so it can be fully integrated with your site's theme.

#### Customization
Options for customizing the lightbox behavior are located in the **Settings > Media** admin menu in the **Lightbox Settings** section (or just click the **Settings** link below the plugin's name when viewing the list of installed plugins)

* **New: Link Validation** (Optional)
* **New: Keyboard Navigation**
* **New: Show/Hide Lightbox Caption**
* Theme Support
* Customizable UI Text
* Enable/Disable Lightbox Functionality (Default: Enabled)
* Enable Lightbox depending on Page Type (Home, Pages, Archive, etc.)
* Automatically activate lightbox for links to images on page (no need to add `rel="lightbox"` attribute to link)
* Group automatically-activated links (play as a slideshow)
* Group image links by Post (separate slideshow for each Post on page)
* Enable/Disable Lightbox resizing animation
* Automatically Start Slideshow (Default: Enabled)
* Slide Duration (Seconds) (Default: 6)
* Loop through images (Default: Enabled)
* Overlay Opacity (0 - 1) (Default: 0.8)

#### Usage
* The necessary Javascript and CSS files will be automatically added to the page as long as `wp_head()` is called in the theme
* That's it!

== Installation ==

1. Verify that your theme uses the `wp_head()` template tag (this is where the necessary files will be added to your theme output)
1. Let plugin automatically add lightbox functionality for links to images or manually add `rel="lightbox"` to any image links that you want to be displayed in a lightbox
