Create a wiki as easily as adding a post

== Description ==

WordPress Wiki Lite transforms your WordPress website into a fully functional wiki or add wiki pages to your WordPress blog.

= You can use Wiki lite to create... =
* A WordPress based Wiki site
* Multiple Wiki sites on a WordPress MultiSite install - so any user of your site can have their own Wiki.
 
= Wiki Pro = 
Wiki lite is a fully functional but limited version of our <a href='http://premium.wpmudev.org/project/wordpress-wiki'>full Wiki plugin</a>. 
This lite version supports creating and editing of Wikis by users who can edit posts in your blog. Users can edit the Wiki from the frontend 
as well as the Admin Dashboard. 
 
Our full version includes many more features: 
 
* **Allow anyone** to edit wikis from frontend 
* **Allow anyone from the network** to edit wikis
